# Create GitHub Actions Workflow Specification

(Imported from awesome-copilot. See upstream for full guidance.)

Use this prompt to generate a comprehensive, implementation-agnostic specification for a GitHub Actions workflow, focusing on purpose, jobs graph, contracts (inputs/outputs/secrets), quality gates, constraints, error handling, observability, compliance, and change management.
